# Road Safety Analysis Dashboard



---

### Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data, developed as part of the selection process for the Data Analysis and Visualization Internship at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. The goal was to transform a raw dataset into a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that uncovers key trends, patterns, and insights related to road safety. The dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of accident statistics, helping to identify major risk factors.

### Key Features

* **Executive KPI Summary:** At-a-glance cards displaying critical metrics like Total Accidents, Total Casualties, and Fatal Accidents.
* **Trend Analysis:** An interactive line chart showing accident trends over time, with drill-down capabilities by year, quarter, and month.
* **Categorical Insights:** Donut, Bar, and Treemap charts providing deep dives into accident severity, weekly patterns, and the impact of junction control.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** An interactive dropdown slicer that allows users to filter the entire dashboard by weather conditions, providing a customized analytical experience.
* **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, modern, and intuitive design with a professional color scheme, clear typography, and a logical layout for easy interpretation.

### Project Workflow

1.  **Data Cleaning & Transformation (in Power Query):**
    * Connected to the source data and performed a thorough data type validation for all columns.
    * Cleaned and standardized categorical data by correcting typos (e.g., "fetal" to "Fatal"), replacing missing values with a consistent "Unknown" category, and consolidating similar entries.
    * Engineered new features by extracting "Day of Week" and "Month Name" from the date field to enable deeper time-based analysis.

2.  **Dashboard Development & Design (in Power BI):**
    * Developed visuals to address all key questions, including KPI cards, charts, and a treemap.
    * Implemented a modern design aesthetic with a clean color palette, rounded borders, and subtle shadows to create a professional and intuitive user interface.
    * Focused on a logical layout and clear, concise titles to ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and the insights are easily accessible.

### Tools & Technologies

* **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for the entire workflow, from data modeling to final dashboard creation.
* **Power Query:** Utilized for all data cleaning, transformation, and preparation tasks.

### Key Insights from the Analysis

* A significant majority of accidents occur at junctions classified as **'Give way or uncontrolled'**, highlighting this as a primary area of risk.
* The data reveals a distinct weekly pattern, with **Fridays** showing the highest frequency of accidents.
* While the overall number of accidents is high, approximately **85%** are classified as 'Slight' in severity.
